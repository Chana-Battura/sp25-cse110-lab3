			<p>
              As we learned it class, it is <b>extremely</b> important to <strong>collaborate</strong>, so we decided to have our first team meeting be in person to get to know each other and build a <em>strong team culture</em>.  Though, <i>some</i> were unable to make it in person, we still did the best that we could to complete our team bonding event. We even made a team page you can access <a href="https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group09/cse110-sp25-group09/blob/main/admin/team.md">here!</a>
